 TODO
 ====
 - FIXME: Google App Engine seems to cache the LP pages. Sometimes an URL can't 
		be downloaded or isn't up-to-date. I think Google App Engine is caching them. 
 		An alternative for urllib is urlfetch(from Google App Engine): 
 		http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch/overview.html - C
 - FIXME: When a package is on the wiki, but not op LP_URL it will disappear, is this desirable?
 - Optional input field LP_URL for when creating a new wiki page - M
 - More config options (option input field for LP url, checkbox for skip finished packages, show packages which only need review, etc) - S
 - Config for upstream packages (don't show) - C
 - Dropdown for selecting a language (and maybe selecting project, i.e. Natty) - C
 - Proper test cases/exmples to check if the code still does what you expect - W


Ideas
=====
 - Cache Launchpad pages (based on URL?) - C
 - Integrate in moinmoin - W
   * Show checkboxes to reserve packages - W


MoSCoW
======
Each item ends with an priority according the MoSCoW prioritisation technique. 
M - MUST have this.
S - SHOULD have this if at all possible.
C - COULD have this if it does not affect anything else.
W - WON'T have this time but WOULD like in the future. Alternatively WANT.
