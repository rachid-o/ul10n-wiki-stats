 - Better check on input and give error messages (wrong URL, no LP url found, couldn't read wiki page, etc)
 - More config options (option input field for LP url, checkbox for skip finished packages, etc)
 - Config for upstream packages (make grey or don't show)
 - Proper test cases/exmples to check if the code still does what you expect
