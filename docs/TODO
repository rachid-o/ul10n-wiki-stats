 TODO
 ====
 - More config options (option input field for LP url, checkbox for skip finished packages, etc) - S
 - Config for upstream packages (don't show) - C
 - Proper test cases/exmples to check if the code still does what you expect - W
 - FIXME: Sometimes an URL can't be downloaded or isn't up-to-date. I think Google App Engine is caching them. An alternative for urllib is urlfetch(from Google App Engine): http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch/overview.html - S

Ideas
=====
 - Cache Launchpad pages (based on URL?) - C
 - Integrate in moinmoin - W
   * Show checkboxes to reserve packages - W

MoSCoW
======
Each item ends with an priority according the MoSCoW prioritisation technique. 
M - MUST have this.
S - SHOULD have this if at all possible.
C - COULD have this if it does not affect anything else.
W - WON'T have this time but WOULD like in the future. Alternatively WANT.
